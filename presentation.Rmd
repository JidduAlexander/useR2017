<!-- ABSTRACT
Connecting to an external database from *R* can be challenging. This is made worse when you need to interact with a database from a live Shiny application. To demystify this process, I'll do two things. 

First, I'll talk about best practices when connecting to a database from Shiny. There are three important packages that help you with this and I'll weave them into this part of the talk. The **DBI** package does a great job of standardizing how to establish a connection, execute safe queries using *SQL* (goodbye *SQL* injections!) and close the connection. The **dplyr** package builds on top of this to make even easier to connect to databases and extract data, since it allows users to query the database using regular **dplyr** syntax in *R* (no *SQL* knowledge necessary). Yet a third package, **pool**, exists to help you when using databases in Shiny applications, by taking care of connection management, and often resulting in better performance. 

Second, I'll demo these concepts in practice by showing how we can connect to a database from Shiny to create a CRUD application. I will show the application running and point out specific parts of the code (which will be publicly available).

## Databases, and its many flavors

- **Relational databases** <-- *We'll focus on these*
- **NoSQL/object oriented databases**

## Databases, and its many flavors

- **Relational**-ish **databases**
    - RDBMSs (relational database management systems) store data in columns and rows, which in turn make up tables. A table in RDBMS is like a spreadsheet. 
    - Use *SQL*.
    - MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite
    - Apache Hive and Cloudera Impala for distributed systems (relational-like) 
    - *R* packages: `DBI`, `odbc`, `dplyr` (and `dbplyr`), `pool`
    
## Databases, and its many flavors

- **NoSQL/object oriented databases**
    - These do not follow the table/row/column approach of RDBMS. Good for working with large amounts of data that do not require structure. Less concerned with storing them in ordered tables than they are with simply making them available for fast access.
    - MongoDB, CouchDB, HBase, Cassandra 

## DBI (theory)

- `DBI` defines the generic **D**ata**B**ase **I**nterface for R. The idea is to standardize how to interact with a database from *R* (connect, disconnect, read, write and mutate data safely from *R*).

- The connection to individual DBMS is provided by other packages that import `DBI` (`DBI`-compliant backends) and implement the methods for the generics defined in `DBI`.

- Current goal: ensure maximum portability and exchangeability and reduce the effort for implementing a new DBI backend (through the `DBItest` package and the [DBI specification](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBI/vignettes/spec.html))

## DBI (practice)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")

DBI::dbWriteTable(con, "iris", iris)

DBI::dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT count() FROM iris")
#>   count()
#> 1     150

DBI::dbDisconnect(con)
```

## DBI (practice) -- *SQL* injections edition!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
sql <- "SELECT * FROM X WHERE name = ?name"
sqlInterpolate(ANSI(), sql, name = "Hadley")
#> <SQL> SELECT * FROM X WHERE name = 'Hadley'

# This is safe because the single quote has been double escaped
sqlInterpolate(ANSI(), sql, name = "H'); DROP TABLE--;")
#> <SQL> SELECT * FROM X WHERE name = 'H''); DROP TABLE--;'
```

## odbc (theory)

- ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is a specification for a database API. This API is independent of any one DBMS, operating system or programming language. The functions in the ODBC API are implemented by developers of DBMS-specific drivers. ([source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/what-is-odbc)) 

- The `odbc` package provides a DBI compliant backend for any database with an ODBC driver (although anyone can write a driver, most of these tend to be paid, enterprise products). This allows for an efficient, easy to setup connection to any database with ODBC drivers available (RStudio Server Pro will soon  bundle several of these drivers including Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Cloudera Impala, Apache Hive and others).

## odbc (practice)

<!-- Since `odbc` acts as "middleman" driver, all arguments to `DBI::dbConnect` have the same names, independent of the database you're connecting to. -->

```{r, eval=FALSE}
con <-  DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), 
  Driver = "{postgresql}",
  Server = "postgresdemo.cfd8mtk93q6a.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com",
  Port = 5432, Database = "postgresdemo",
  UID = "guest",
  PWD = "guest"
)

DBI::dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM city LIMIT 2;")
#>   id     name countrycode district population
#> 1  1    Kabul         AFG    Kabol    1780000
#> 2  2 Qandahar         AFG Qandahar     237500

DBI::dbDisconnect(con)
```

## dplyr (theory)

- **Idea**: use `dplyr` syntax to talk to databases (no *SQL* involved for the end user).

- `dplyr` (and the brand-new `dbplyr`) wrap and extend a lot of `DBI` methods, so that you can use `dplyr` + *R* directly to interact with your database (instead of `DBI` + `SQL` -- basically, `dplyr` does that for you)

- With the recent revamp, you can a LOT with `dplyr` (reading and transforming data, writing tables, querying the database), but `DBI` still allows you to do more (the price you pay...)

- **Bottom line**: Especially if you're already familiar with the `dplyr` verbs (mainly, `filter()`,
`select()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, and `summarise()`), using `dplyr` to interact with databases is a great idea.

## dplyr (practice)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(),
  dbname = "shinydemo",
  host = "shiny-demo.csa7qlmguqrf.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
  username = "guest", 
  password = "guest"
)
con %>% tbl("City") %>% head(2)
#> # Source:   lazy query [?? x 5]
#> # Database: mysql 5.5.5-10.0.17-MariaDB
#> #   [guest@shiny-demo (...) amazonaws.com:/shinydemo]
#>      ID     Name CountryCode District Population
#>   <dbl>    <chr>       <chr>    <chr>      <dbl>
#> 1     1    Kabul         AFG    Kabol    1780000
#> 2     2 Qandahar         AFG Qandahar     237500

DBI::dbDisconnect(con)
```

## pool (theory)

- **Problem**: how to interact with a database from Shiny? 
    - Per session, there is only a single R process and potentially multiple users.
    - Also, establishing connections takes time and they can go down at any time.
    - So, you don’t want a fresh connection every for every user action (because that’s slow), and you don’t want one connection per app (because that’s unreliable)...

- The `pool` package allows you to manage a shared pool of connections for your app, giving you both speed (good performance) and reliability (connection management).

## pool (theory)

- `pool` is mainly important when in a Shiny app (or another interactive app with an R backend), but it can be used in other situations with no problem.

- `pool` integrates seamlessly with both `DBI` and `dplyr` (the only noticeable differences are in the create/connect and close/disconnect functions).

- Will be released to CRAN very soon!

## pool (practice)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pool <- pool::dbPool(RMySQL::MySQL(),
  dbname = "shinydemo",
  host = "shiny-demo.csa7qlmguqrf.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
  username = "guest", 
  password = "guest"
)
pool %>% tbl("City") %>% head(2)
#> # Source:   lazy query [?? x 5]
#> # Database: mysql 5.5.5-10.0.17-MariaDB
#> #   [guest@shiny-demo (...) amazonaws.com:/shinydemo]
#>      ID     Name CountryCode District Population
#>   <dbl>    <chr>       <chr>    <chr>      <dbl>
#> 1     1    Kabul         AFG    Kabol    1780000
#> 2     2 Qandahar         AFG Qandahar     237500

pool::poolClose(pool)
```
